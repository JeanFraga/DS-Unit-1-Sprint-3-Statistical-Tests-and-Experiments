The data consists of 435 instances (one for each congressperson), a class (democrat or republican), and 16 binary attributes (yes or no for voting for or against certain issues). Be aware - there are missing values!\n","\n","Your goals:\n","\n","1. Load and clean the data (or determine the best method to drop observations when running tests)\n","2. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue that democrats support more than republicans with p < 0.01\n","3. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue that republicans support more than democrats with p < 0.01\n","4. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue where the difference between republicans and democrats has p > 0.1 (i.e. there may not be much of a difference)\n","\n","Note that this data will involve *2 sample* t-tests, because you're comparing averages across two groups (republicans and democrats) rather than a single group against a null hypothesis.\n","\n","Stretch goals:\n","\n","1. Refactor your code into functions so it's easy to rerun with arbitrary variables\n","2. Apply hypothesis testing to your personal project data (for the purposes of this notebook you can type a summary of the hypothesis you formed and tested)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RTPkbwZVm21c","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":222},"outputId":"d3218fe2-0742-4dea-fe30-576b97932622","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1568666338886,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1790,"user":{"displayName":"Jean
